\arguments{
\item{syear}{Survival time horizon (e.g., median survival time) in years.}

\item{yrsurv2}{Survival probability of the test group at \code{syear}.}

\item{alloc}{Allocation ratio (Test / Standard), e.g., 1 means equal allocation.}

\item{accrualTime}{Duration of patient accrual period.}

\item{followTime}{Follow-up period after last patient is accrued.}

\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level (e.g., 0.025).}

\item{power}{Desired statistical power (e.g., 0.8).}

\item{margin}{Non-inferiority margin for hazard ratio (HR).}
}

A list containing:
\describe{
\item{Sample_size_of_standard_group}{Required sample size in the standard group.}
\item{Sample_size_of_test_group}{Required sample size in the test group.}
\item{Total_sample_size}{Total sample size.}
\item{Expected_event_numbers_of_standard_group}{Expected number of events in the standard group.}
\item{Expected_event_numbers_of_test_group}{Expected number of events in the test group.}
\item{Total_expected_event_numbers}{Total number of expected events across both groups.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the required sample size and expected event numbers for a non-inferiority trial with two survival curves,
using piecewise integration of hazard functions under exponential survival assumptions.
